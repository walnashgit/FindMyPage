# Smart Bookmarks Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that lets you bookmark any webpage and then search it based on the content

## Features

1. **Page Indexing**: Add web pages to your search index for later retrieval
2. **Search**: Search through previously indexed web pages
3. **Search Highlighting**: Automatically highlight search terms when visiting search results

## Setup Instructions

1. **Start the MCP Server**
   ```
   cd path/to/your/project
   python mcp/mcp_server.py sse
   ```

2. **Load the Chrome Extension**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top-right corner)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `chrome-extension` directory
   - The Smart Bookmarks extension should now be visible in your extensions list

3. **Use the Extension**
   - Click on the Smart Bookmarks icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the popup
   
   
   **To Add a Page to Your Index:**
   - Navigate to the web page you want to add
   - Click on the Smart Bookmarks icon to open the popup
   - Click the "Add Page" button in the top-right corner
   - Wait for the confirmation message
   
   **To Search Indexed Content:**
   - Enter your search terms in the text area
   - Click the "Search" button
   - View the search results showing content from previously indexed pages
   - Click on any result URL to open the page with your search terms automatically highlighted

## Search Highlighting

The extension now includes an automatic search term highlighting feature:

1. When you search for content and click on a result, the page opens in a new tab
2. Your search terms are automatically highlighted in yellow
3. The page automatically scrolls to the first occurrence of your search terms
4. All matching terms throughout the page are highlighted for easy scanning

This makes it much easier to find relevant information within lengthy web pages.

## Notes

- The MCP server must be running at http://127.0.0.1:7172 for the extension to work
- This extension requires permission to communicate with your local server and access page content
- For security reasons, keep the extension in development mode and don't distribute it publicly
- Indexed content is stored in the `mcp/faiss_index` directory

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter connection errors, ensure the MCP server is running
- Check the Chrome console for error messages (right-click extension popup â†’ Inspect)
- Make sure your firewall or security software isn't blocking local connections
- If search returns no results, try adding some pages first using the "Add Page" button
- If highlighting doesn't work, make sure you've granted the extension permission to access website content
