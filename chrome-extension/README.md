## Notes

- The MCP server must be running at http://127.0.0.1:7172 for the extension to work
- This extension requires permission to communicate with your local server and access page content
- For security reasons, keep the extension in development mode and don't distribute it publicly
- Indexed content is stored in the `mcp/faiss_index` directory

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter connection errors, ensure the MCP server is running
- Check the Chrome console for error messages (right-click extension popup â†’ Inspect)
- Make sure your firewall or security software isn't blocking local connections
- If search returns no results, try adding some pages first using the "Add Page" button
