It is conceptually similar to a thread, in the sense that it takes a block of code to run that works concurrently with the rest of the code. However, a coroutine is not bound to any particular thread. It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one. Coroutines can be thought of",

It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one. Coroutines can be thought of as light-weight threads, but there is a number of important differences that make their real-life usage very different from threads. Run the following code to get to your first working coroutine: `import kotlinx.coroutines.* //sampleStart fun main() = runBlocking { // this: CoroutineScope launch { // launch a new coroutine and continue delay(1000L) // non-blocking delay for 1 second (default time unit is ms) println(\"World!\") // print after delay } println(\"Hello\") // main coroutine continues while a previous one is delayed } //sampleEnd` ``` xxxxxxxxxx ``` ``` fun main() = runBlocking { // this: CoroutineScope ``` ``` launch { // launch a new coroutine and continue ``` ``` delay(1000L) // non-blocking delay for 1 second (default time unit is ms) ``` ``` println(\"World!\") // print after delay ``` ``` } ``` ``` println(\"Hello\") // main coroutine continues while a previous one is delayed ``` ``` } ``` [Open in Playground \u2192](https://play.kotlinlang.org/editor/v1/N4Igxg9gJgpiBcICWBbADhATgFwAQGsJsAbJAOwA8A6STCAV23JgGcqAqAHTO%2B4DN6ZXCgCG5ABQBKXAF5cmQQCFiEMPnIBzXMFwB6XbmwALJC3i4AwlgZMyMAMqQ0Mbrje5iIwWCPa9Bz29fEVw7AHdcWhtmXBEyKEiIMlt6FyF3DNhPAE9xAEYABiKAGWl9UKSAWgAjFTVNXCyRbNw%2BLFw83BYYSHjccVg%2BL2I8JhQYXEEkPFNhFklXDPc0THISMnFOEAB1LGIoAEItsoMVtdi%2BbBhMRpgcxbcAXwfcM%2BTiDa2ACTuVY/9hGIhFFGDFeilWLgwiZiBMQisYAA3JAMFi4JITWZNbIwKDcZ5kEAAGhA2BEmA0MGwAAVPNg2pgUAgQAArESIkTE8AQdBIWGYABq1xYKMJiAATFQ8lRxQUQI8gA%3D%3D%3D) Target: JVMRunning on v.2.1.20 > ### note > > You can get the full code [here](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/kotlinx-coroutines-core/jvm/test/guide/example-basic-01.kt). You will see the following result: ``` Hello World! ``` Let's dissect what this code does. [launch](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/launch.html) is a coroutine builder. It launches a new coroutine concurrently with the rest of the code, which continues to work independently. That's why `Hello` has been printed first. [delay](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/delay.html) is a special suspending",

[delay](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/delay.html) is a special suspending function. It suspends the coroutine for a specific time. Suspending a coroutine does not block the underlying thread, but allows other coroutines to run and use the underlying thread for their code. [runBlocking](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/run-blocking.html) is also a coroutine builder that bridges the non-coroutine world of a regular `fun main()` and the code with coroutines inside of `runBlocking { ... }` curly braces. This is highlighted in an IDE by `this: CoroutineScope` hint right after the `runBlocking` opening curly brace. If you remove or forget `runBlocking` in this code, you'll get an error on the [launch](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/launch.html) call, since `launch` is declared only on the [CoroutineScope](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-coroutine-scope/index.html): ``` Unresolved reference: launch ``` The name of `runBlocking` means that the thread that runs it (in this case \u2014 the main thread) gets blocked for the duration of the call, until all the coroutines inside `runBlocking { ... }` complete their execution. You will often see `runBlocking` used like that at the very top-level of the application and quite rarely inside the real code, as threads are expensive resources and blocking them is inefficient and is often not desired. ### Structured concurrency\ufeff Coroutines follow a principle of structured concurrency which means that new coroutines can only be launched in a specific [CoroutineScope](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-coroutine-scope/index.html) which delimits the lifetime of the coroutine.

The above example shows that [runBlocking](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/run-blocking.html) establishes the corresponding scope and that is why the previous example waits until `World!` is printed after a second's delay and only then exits. In a real application, you will be launching a lot of coroutines. Structured concurrency ensures that they are not lost and do not leak. An outer scope cannot complete until all its children coroutines complete. Structured concurrency also ensures that any errors in the code are properly reported and are never lost. ## Extract function refactoring\ufeff Let's extract the block of code inside `launch { ... }` into a separate function. When you perform \"Extract function\" refactoring on this code, you get a new function with the `suspend` modifier. This is your first suspending function. Suspending functions can be used inside coroutines just like regular functions, but their additional feature is that they can, in turn, use other suspending functions (like `delay` in this example) to suspend execution of a coroutine. `import kotlinx.coroutines.* //sampleStart fun main() = runBlocking { // this: CoroutineScope launch { doWorld() } println(\"Hello\") } // this is your first suspending function suspend fun doWorld() { delay(1000L) println(\"World!\") } //sampleEnd` ``` xxxxxxxxxx ``` ``` fun main() = runBlocking { // this: CoroutineScope ``` ``` launch { doWorld() } ``` ``` println(\"Hello\") ``` ``` } ``` ```",

It creates a coroutine scope and does not complete until all launched children complete. [runBlocking](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/run-blocking.html) and [coroutineScope](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/coroutine-scope.html) builders may look similar because they both wait for their body and all its children to complete. The main difference is that the [runBlocking](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/run-blocking.html) method blocks the current thread for waiting, while [coroutineScope](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/coroutine-scope.html) just suspends, releasing the underlying thread for other usages. Because of that difference, [runBlocking](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/run-blocking.html) is a regular function and [coroutineScope](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/coroutine-scope.html) is a suspending function. You can use `coroutineScope` from any suspending function. For example, you can move the concurrent printing of `Hello` and `World` into a `suspend fun doWorld()` function: `import kotlinx.coroutines.* //sampleStart fun main() = runBlocking { doWorld() } suspend fun doWorld() = coroutineScope { // this: CoroutineScope launch { delay(1000L) println(\"World!\") } println(\"Hello\") } //sampleEnd` ``` xxxxxxxxxx ``` ``` fun main() = runBlocking { ``` ``` doWorld() ``` ``` } ``` ``` \u200b",

Let's launch two concurrent coroutines inside a `doWorld` suspending function: `import kotlinx.coroutines.* //sampleStart // Sequentially executes doWorld followed by \"Done\" fun main() = runBlocking { doWorld() println(\"Done\") } // Concurrently executes both sections suspend fun doWorld() = coroutineScope { // this: CoroutineScope launch { delay(2000L) println(\"World 2\") } launch { delay(1000L) println(\"World 1\") } println(\"Hello\") } //sampleEnd` ``` xxxxxxxxxx ``` ``` // Sequentially executes doWorld followed by \"Done\" ``` ``` fun main() = runBlocking { ``` ``` doWorld() ``` ``` println(\"Done\") ``` ``` } ``` ``` \u200b ``` ``` // Concurrently executes both sections ``` ``` suspend fun doWorld() = coroutineScope { // this: CoroutineScope ``` ``` launch { ``` ``` delay(2000L) ``` ``` println(\"World 2\") ``` ``` } ``` ``` launch { ``` ``` delay(1000L) ``` ``` println(\"World 1\") ``` ``` } ``` ``` println(\"Hello\") ```",

Both pieces of code inside `launch { ... }` blocks execute concurrently, with `World 1` printed first, after a second from start, and `World 2` printed next, after two seconds from start. A [coroutineScope](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/coroutine-scope.html) in `doWorld` completes only after both are complete, so `doWorld` returns and allows `Done` string to be printed only after that: ``` Hello World 1 World 2 Done ``` ## An explicit job\ufeff A [launch](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/launch.html) coroutine builder returns a [Job](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-job/index.html) object that is a handle to the launched coroutine and can be used to wait for its completion explicitly. For example, you can wait for the completion of the child coroutine and then print the \"Done\" string: `import kotlinx.coroutines.* fun main() = runBlocking { //sampleStart val job = launch { // launch a new coroutine and keep a reference to its Job delay(1000L) println(\"World!\") } println(\"Hello\") job.join() // wait until child coroutine completes println(\"Done\") //sampleEnd }` ``` xxxxxxxxxx ``` ``` val job = launch { // launch a new coroutine and keep a reference to its Job ``` ``` delay(1000L) ``` ``` println(\"World!\") ``` ``` } ``` ``` println(\"Hello\") ``` ``` job.join() // wait until child coroutine completes ```",

This code produces: ``` Hello World! Done ``` ## Coroutines are light-weight\ufeff Coroutines are less resource-intensive than JVM threads. Code that exhausts the JVM's available memory when using threads can be expressed using coroutines without hitting resource limits. For example, the following code launches 50,000 distinct coroutines that each waits 5 seconds and then prints a period ('.') while consuming very little memory: `import kotlinx.coroutines.* fun main() = runBlocking { repeat(50_000) { // launch a lot of coroutines launch { delay(5000L) print(\".\") } } }` ``` xxxxxxxxxx ``` ``` import kotlinx.coroutines.* ``` ``` \u200b ``` ``` fun main() = runBlocking { ``` ``` repeat(50_000) { // launch a lot of coroutines ``` ``` launch { ``` ``` delay(5000L) ``` ``` print(\".\") ``` ``` } ``` ``` } ``` ``` } ``` [Open in Playground \u2192](https://play.kotlinlang.org/editor/v1/N4Igxg9gJgpiBcICWBbADhATgFwAQGsJsAbJAOwA8A6STCAV23JgGcqAqAHTO4DN6yuFAENyACgCUuALy5MAgELEIYfOQDmuYN1y65MNDGHYxAVgAMAfXM2pwXAHoHuYsIFgAFrmEuiuCLy4tAxMZKw6epGu7l7agpEJurCuAJ5mNuYAMhIRiZFomOQmnCBUJTnxiQC%2Bubg1ZFUgADQg2MKY6jDYAAqu2LxYKAggAFbCAG7CzeAQ6EjEMJgAaossSBBkwwBMVACMVFvmIFVAA%3D%3D%3D) Target: JVMRunning on v.2.1.20 > ### note > > You can get the full code [here](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/kotlinx-coroutines-core/jvm/test/guide/example-basic-06.kt).

They have many powerful health benefits for your body and brain. In fact, few nutrients have been studied as thoroughly as omega-3 fatty acids.

Here are 17 health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids that are supported by science. ## 1. May benefit depression and anxiety [Depression](https://www.healthline.com/health/omega-3-depression) is one of the [most commonTrusted Source](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/major-depression) mental disorders in the world. Symptoms often include sadness, lethargy, and a general loss of interest in life. [Anxiety](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety), another common disorder, is characterized by feelings of fear, panic, and restlessness. Research suggests people who consume omega-3s regularly are [less likely](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11354246/) to have depression. What\u2019s more, studies in people with depression and [anxiety](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6324500/) suggest that [omega-3 supplements](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/omega-3-supplement-guide) may improve symptoms. There are [three types of omega-3](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/3-types-of-omega-3) fatty acids: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Of the three, EPA appears to be the [most beneficial](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6683166/) for depression. > **summary** > > Omega-3 supplements may help treat and prevent depression and anxiety. EPA seems to be the most effective at reducing symptoms of depression. ## 2. May improve eye health DHA, a type of omega-3, is a major structural component of the retina of [your eye](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-nutrients-for-eyes). When you don\u2019t get enough DHA, vision problems [may arise](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8000043/). Interestingly, getting enough omega-3 is also linked to a [reduced riskTrusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34749130/) of [macular degeneration](https://www.healthline.com/health/macular-degeneration), one of the leading causes of permanent eye damage and blindness worldwide. > **summary** > > An omega-3 fatty acid called DHA is a major structural component of your eyes\u2019 retinas.

Could promote brain health during pregnancy and early life Omega-3s are crucial for brain growth and development in infants. Getting enough omega-3s during [pregnancy](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-foods-to-eat-when-pregnant) is [associated withTrusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33506965/) numerous [benefitsTrusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33742211/) for your child, including: * improved cognitive development * better communication and social skills * fewer behavioral problems * decreased risk of developmental delay However, more research is needed, as some studies have produced [mixed resultsTrusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34383914/). > **summary** > > Getting enough omega-3s during pregnancy and early life is crucial for your child\u2019s development. Omega-3 supplementation is linked to improved cognitive development and a lower risk of developmental delay. ## 4. May improve risk factors for heart disease Heart attacks and strokes are the world\u2019s [leading causesTrusted Source](https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death) of death. Decades ago, [researchersTrusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12848280/) observed that [fish-eating](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-health-benefits-of-fish) communities had very low rates of these diseases. This was [later linkedTrusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18541598/) to omega-3 consumption. Since then, omega-3 fatty acids have been tied to [numerous benefits](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7827286/) for [heart health](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/heart-healthy-foods). These benefits include: * **Triglycerides:** Omega-3s can significantly [reduce levelsTrusted Source](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000709) of [triglycerides](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-ways-to-lower-triglycerides). * **HDL cholesterol:** Some [older studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622029467?via%3Dihub) suggest that omega-3s could raise HDL (good) cholesterol levels. * **Blood clots:** Some [older researchTrusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25703517/) suggests that omega-3s can prevent blood platelets from clumping together, which can help prevent the formation of harmful blood",

It is a major public health concern because it increases your risk of many other illnesses, including heart disease and diabetes. [Some research](https://www.clinicalnutritionjournal.com/article/S0261-5614%2819%2930146-3/abstract) suggests that omega-3 fatty acids could help improve blood sugar levels, inflammation, and heart disease risk factors in people with metabolic syndrome. > **summary** > > Omega-3s may have numerous benefits for people with metabolic syndrome. They could improve blood sugar levels, reduce inflammation, and improve several heart disease risk factors. ## 7. May reduce inflammation Inflammation is a natural response to infections and damage in your body. Therefore, it is vital for your health. However, [inflammation](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anti-inflammatory-diet-101) sometimes persists for a long time, even without an infection or injury. This is called chronic \u2014 or long-term \u2014 inflammation. Long-term inflammation [may contribute](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7147972/) to almost every chronic illness, including heart disease and cancer. Notably, omega-3 fatty acids can [reduce the production](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4726565/) of molecules and substances linked to inflammation, such as inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines.

It follows material design principle and provides [slots](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/layout#slot-based-layouts) to fill in with components like top bar, bottom bar, navigation drawer, FAB etc. It\u2019s like a template that can be modified based on the requirement. In the [previous post](/navigation-drawer-using-jetpack-compose-27ea7db74903) I talked about navigation using navigation drawer. This did not use a scaffold. In this post I\u2019ll show navigation using bottom navigation (and navigation drawer) created using a scaffold. Most of the things will be pretty similar to what we saw in the previous post. Here\u2019s what we are trying to achieve for this post: ![]() The app launches with a default homescreen. The home screen has three screens that it can navigate to from the bottom navigation. The drawer also has three screens to navigate; Home (default screen on launch), Account and Help. The bottom navigation is available for home screen only. **Screens** The screens are divided in to two categories, HomeScreens (navigable from bottom nav) and DrawerScreens (navigable from drawer). Each screen is just a simple composable with a text: **ViewModel** To keep a track of the screen we are in, we\u2019ll",

Each screen is just a simple composable with a text: **ViewModel** To keep a track of the screen we are in, we\u2019ll use a view model. **Bottom Navigation** The BottomNavigation code looks like this. Pretty much same as what we had for navigation from drawer. Here we are using the backStackEntry to mark the selected screen. **Scaffold** Lets checkout the scaffold code: The Scaffold composable takes various UI components as parameters. For our use case we are passing in the topBar, bottomBar and a drawer. Our top bar is different in *help* screen. It has a back button, so our top bar changes based on the screen. Also, the bottom bar is present only for Home and the 3 home screens. Hence, both of these are set conditionally. We pass NavigationHost composable as a content to the Scaffold. This means that our screens will be contained within the components of the scaffold, in our case, between the top and the bottom bar. It is for this reason that the individual screens do not have a top bar present. **Navigation Host** The Navigation host has all the screens added to the graph that we need.

A point to note here is that we have not used any animation while navigating and that is because animation is still being worked upon in [compose navigation](https://issuetracker.google.com/172112072). # Additional Readings **Handling back press** In the above and the previous post, you will notice that (when you run the app) when the drawer is open, it does not closes on press of device back button. To handle this, we\u2019ll intercept the backpress and close the drawer if it\u2019s open. We\u2019ll add this below code at the beginning of our AppScaffold composable: The *BackPressHandler* is as below: This handler adds a callback to the back press dispatcher which is obtained from [CompositionLocal](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/CompositionLocal). A CompositionLocal is a way of passing data between compositions. Read more about CompositionLocal here: <https://medium.com/mobile-app-development-publication/android-jetpack-compose-compositionlocal-made-easy-8632b201bfcd> <https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/CompositionLocal> The callback to handle back press is registered and unregistered using a [*DisposableEffect*](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lifecycle#disposableeffect). A *DisposableEffect* is a side effect which is used when a cleanup is required when the Key of the effect changes or the composable leaves the composition. Read more here: https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lifecycle#disposableeffect Read more about side effects here: <https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/lifecycle> <https://jorgecastillo.dev/jetpack-compose-effect-handlers> To provide the backpress dispatcher to the composables we need to wrap it with [*CompositionLocalProvider*](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/package-summary#CompositionLocalProvider(kotlin.Array,kotlin.Function0)). Since we need it at scaffold itself, we wrap our AppScaffold with it. This will provide the dispatcher to AppScaffold and all the other composables under this tree. The above code for the backpress handler is",

Since we need it at scaffold itself, we wrap our AppScaffold with it. This will provide the dispatcher to AppScaffold and all the other composables under this tree. The above code for the backpress handler is taken from this Compose sample: [JetChat](https://github.com/android/compose-samples/blob/main/Jetchat/app/src/main/java/com/example/compose/jetchat/conversation/BackHandler.kt) **Handling State Across Screens** While state in a particular screen/composable can be retained across re-composition by using *remember,* the same is lost when the screen/composable navigates to a different composable and leaves the composition. Eg: ![]() Here, I have added a button in the *favorite* screen. On click, the text in the button updates and shows number of times it has been clicked. This is achieved by using *rememberSaveable* (same as remember but retains sate on reconfiguration of screen when device is rotated), which remembers the click value every time the button composable is recomposed and updates it to the new value. But the value is reset when you navigate to a different screen and come back. To retain a state across different screen/composable we can use a ViewModel. The viewmodel is bound to the lifecycle of the activity and the same is passed to each composable. We use the view model to retain the state of the button click count. The composable for Favorite screen now looks like this: Here we observe the clickCount livedata as a state from the viewmodel and use a local variable *click* to update the count. And now our state for click count is retained even when the screen changes. ![]() And that\u2019s all",
